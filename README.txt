||#|| Automotive industry smart contract ||#||

|*||| PROJECT 1.1 - Automotive industry smart contract |||*|

    Vehicle struct:
        This struct defines the properties of a vehicle, including make, model, price, vehicleId, isSold, seller, and buyer.

    listVehicle function:
        This function allows a user to list a new vehicle for sale.
        It takes in the parameters _make, _model, _price, and _vehicleId, which represent the make, model, price, and unique ID of the vehicle.
        Inside the function, a new Vehicle struct called newVehicle is created with the provided details.
        The seller address is set to msg.sender, which is the address of the user who called the function.
        The buyer address is initially set to address(0), indicating that the vehicle has not been sold yet.
        The newVehicle is then added to the vehicles array using the push function.
        Finally, the VehicleListed event is emitted, capturing the details of the newly listed vehicle.

This code allows users to list vehicles for sale by creating new Vehicle structs and adding them to the vehicles array.
Each listed vehicle will have a unique ID, and the event VehicleListed will be emitted
to notify listeners of the listing.

|*||| PROJECT 1.2 - Automotive industry smart contract |||*|

This smart contract represents an automotive contract that allows users to buy vehicles. 

    State Variables:
        owner: This variable stores the address of the contract owner.
        buyers: This is a mapping that keeps track of buyers and whether they have already made a purchase.
        vehicleMake and vehicleModel: These variables store the make and model of the vehicle.
        vehiclePrice: This variable stores the price of the vehicle.

    Event:
        Purchase: This event is emitted when a vehicle is purchased. It logs the buyer's address, vehicle make and model, and the vehicle price.

    Constructor:
        The constructor is executed when the contract is deployed. It sets the owner variable to the address of the contract deployer.

    buyVehicle Function:
        This function allows users to buy a vehicle by providing the vehicle make and model as arguments.
        The function requires that the value sent with the transaction (msg.value) is greater than or equal to the vehiclePrice.
        It also checks that the buyer has not already made a purchase (buyers[msg.sender] == false).
        If the conditions are met, the vehicle make and model are updated, and the buyer is marked as having made a purchase.
        The Purchase event is emitted, capturing the buyer's address, vehicle make and model, and the vehicle price.


||#|| Banking industry smart contract ||#||

|*||| PROJECT 2.1 - Banking industry smart contract |||*|

In the Solidity code, we have a smart contract called Banking. Let's go through the different parts of the contract:

    State Variables:
        balances: This is a mapping that associates an address with a balance. 
                  It keeps track of the balances of different addresses.
        owner: This is an address variable that represents the owner of the contract.

    Constructor:
        The constructor function is executed when the contract is deployed. 
        It sets the owner variable to the address of the contract deployer (msg.sender).

    deposit Function:
        # This function allows users to deposit an amount of Ether into their balance.
        # It requires that the deposited amount is greater than 0.
        # The function increases the balance of the msg.sender address by the deposited amount.

    withdraw Function:
        # This function allows the owner of the contract to withdraw 
          an amount of Ether from their balance.
        # It requires that the caller of the function is the owner of the contract (msg.sender == owner).
        # It also requires that the withdrawal amount is not greater than
          the balance of the owner and is greater than 0.
        # The function transfers the specified amount of Ether to the owner's
          address and decreases their balance accordingly.

    transfer Function:
        # This function allows the caller to transfer a specified amount of Ether to a recipient address.
        # It requires that the transfer amount is not greater than the caller's balance.
        # The function transfers the specified amount of Ether to the recipient address and 
          updates the balances of the caller and recipient accordingly.

Overall, this contract provides basic banking functionalities such as depositing, withdrawing,
and transferring Ether. The balances mapping keeps track of the balances of different addresses.


|*||| PROJECT 2.2 - Banking industry smart contract |||*|

    contract Banking {
        # This declares the start of the contract named "Banking".

    mapping (address => uint256) public balances;
        # This creates a mapping data structure that associates an address
          with an unsigned integer value representing the balance of that address.

    address payable owner;
        # This declares a state variable named "owner" of type
          "address payable" to store the owner's address.

    constructor() {
        # This is the constructor function that is executed when the contract is deployed. 
          It initializes the "owner" variable with the address of the contract deployer.

    function deposit() public payable {
        # This is a public function named "deposit" that allows
          users to deposit funds into their account. 
          It is marked as "payable" to receive Ether along with the function call.

    require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0.");
        # This is a require statement that checks if the deposited amount is greater than 0.
          If the condition is not met, it reverts the transaction with the provided error message.

    balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        # This increases the balance of the sender's address by
          the deposited amount.

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public payable {
        # This is a public function named "withdraw" that allows
          the owner to withdraw funds from the contract.

    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw!");
        # This require statement checks if the sender is the owner of the contract.
          If not, it reverts the transaction with the provided error message.

    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient funds!");
        # This require statement checks if the requested withdrawal amount is
          less than or equal to the balance of the owner's address. 
          If not, it reverts the transaction with the provided error message.

    require(amount > 0, "Withdrawal amount must be greater than 0!");
        # This require statement checks if the requested withdrawal amount is greater than 0. 
          If not, it reverts the transaction with the provided error message.

    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        # This transfers the requested withdrawal amount from the contract to the owner's address.

    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        # This decreases the balance of the owner's address by the withdrawn amount.

    function transfer(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        # This is a public function named "transfer" that allows
          the owner to transfer funds to a specified recipient.

    require(amount >= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance!");
        # This require statement checks if the requested transfer amount is
          less than or equal to the balance of the owner's address. 
          If not, it reverts the transaction with the provided error message.

    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        # This decreases the balance of the owner's address by the transferred amount.

    balances[recipient] += amount;
        # This increases the balance of the recipient's address by the transferred amount.

These are the main lines, functions, and functionalities used in the smart contract.
It allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds,

|*||| Crowd fund smart contract |||*|

|*||| PROJECT 3.1 - Crowd funding smart contract |||*|

This Solidity contract implements a crowdfunding platform on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The contract allows individuals to contribute ether towards a funding goal within a specified time frame. 
If the goal is reached before the deadline, the funds can be withdrawn by the contract owner.
Otherwise, contributors can reclaim their contributions. 
The contract includes features to prevent common vulnerabilities and ensures a fair and 
transparent crowdfunding process.

=> Key Features:

    # Initialization: The crowdfunding campaign is initialized with a specific funding goal
        and deadline upon deployment by the contract owner.
    
    # Contributions: Anyone can contribute to the crowdfunding campaign until the deadline is reached.
        Contributions are recorded, and the total contributions are updated accordingly.
    
    # Withdrawal and Refunds: If the funding goal is met, the contract owner can withdraw the funds.
        If the goal is not met by the deadline, contributors can request refunds.
    
    # Deadline Management: The contract owner can extend the deadline to give more time for contributions.
        However, the owner cannot set the deadline to less than 5 minutes from the current time to prevent abuse.
    
    # Event Logging: Events are emitted for key actions such as reaching the funding goal, 
        transferring funds, and reaching the deadline, enabling off-chain applications to
        react to these changes.

=> Security Measures:

    # Modifiers: The contract uses modifiers to restrict certain functions to the contract
        owner, ensuring that only the owner can withdraw funds or modify the deadline.
    # Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern: To prevent reentrancy attacks, 
        especially in the refund process, the contract updates its state before 
        transferring ether out.

=> Usage:

    # This contract is suitable for creators looking to fund projects, products, or services 
        through contributions from the public. 
        It provides a transparent and secure mechanism for raising funds and ensures 
        that contributors have the option to get refunds if the project's funding 
        goals are not met.

=> Conclusion:

    # The Crowdfunding contract is a comprehensive solution for launching decentralized
      crowdfunding campaigns on the Ethereum blockchain. 
      It balances flexibility for the campaign owner with security and fairness 
      for contributors, leveraging the Ethereum network's capabilities to facilitate
      open and fair fundraising activities.

|*||| PROJECT 3.2 - Crowd funding smart contract |||*|

In the provided smart contract, CrowdFund, is a crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum
blockchain using the Solidity programming language. It leverages ERC20 tokens as the 
medium of exchange, allowing users to fund projects (campaigns) of their choice with 
specific tokens. Here’s an overview of its main features and functionalities:
 => Key Components

    # ERC20 Token Interface (IERC20): This contract interface defines the standard 
      functions of ERC20 tokens that are used within the CrowdFund contract, namely 
      transfer and transferFrom. These functions enable the contract to send and 
      receive the ERC20 tokens that are used for crowdfunding.

    # Campaign Structure: A struct that stores essential data about each crowdfunding 
      campaign, including the creator's address, the funding goal, total pledged amount,
      start and end timestamps, and a flag indicating whether the funds have been claimed.

    # Events: The contract defines several events (Launch, Cancel, Pledge, Unpledge, Claim,
      Refund) to log significant actions on the blockchain, providing transparency for all
      interactions with the contract.

=> Main Functionalities

    # Launching a Campaign: Users can create a new crowdfunding campaign by specifying the
      funding goal, start time, and end time. The contract ensures that the start time 
      is in the future and the duration does not exceed a predefined maximum (90 days).

    # Cancelling a Campaign: The creator of a campaign can cancel it before it
      starts, ensuring that users have control over their campaigns if conditions change 
      before the fundraising begins.

    # Pledging to a Campaign: Users can support a campaign by pledging ERC20 tokens
      to it. The contract updates the total pledged amount and records the contribution 
      against the user's address.

    # Unpledging: Users can withdraw their pledge from a campaign before it ends,
      offering flexibility and control over their funds.

    # Claiming Funds: Upon the successful completion of a campaign (i.e., reaching
      or surpassing the funding goal by the end time), the campaign creator can claim the 
      pledged funds.

    # Refunds: If a campaign does not reach its funding goal, contributors can
      claim a refund of their pledged tokens after the campaign ends.

=> Security and Flexibility

The contract includes checks to ensure actions are performed within the correct context
(e.g., campaigns can only be cancelled before they start, funds can only be claimed after
 the end, etc.). It uses the require statements extensively to enforce rules and validate conditions.

|*||| PROJECT 4.2 - Crypto exchange smart contract |||*|

The code snippet you've provided involves importing an interface for ERC-20 tokens 
using OpenZeppelin, a widely recognized library in the Ethereum development community 
for secure smart contract development. This particular import statement is typically
used at the beginning of a Solidity smart contract file when the contract needs to 
interact with ERC-20 tokens, whether it's creating a new token that complies with 
the ERC-20 standard or interacting with existing ERC-20 tokens on the blockchain.

=> Key Points of the Code:

    Use of OpenZeppelin Contracts: OpenZeppelin provides a set of secure, audited, and 
    community-reviewed smart contracts that implement various blockchain standards and utilities. 
    By importing from OpenZeppelin, developers leverage this expertise and security in 
    their own contracts.

    ## IERC20 Interface: The IERC20 interface defines a set of functions that an ERC-20 token contract should implement, allowing for standardized interactions such as transferring tokens, approving tokens for spending by third parties, and querying balance information. The functions include:
        # totalSupply: Returns the total token supply.
        
        # balanceOf: Provides the number of tokens held by a given address.
        
        # transfer: Enables the transfer of tokens from the message sender's
          account to another account.
        
        # approve: Allows a spender to withdraw a specified amount of tokens
          from a specified account.
        
        # transferFrom: Facilitates the transfer of tokens from one account to another, 
          based on a previously set allowance.
        
        # allowance: Returns the amount of tokens that an owner has allowed
         a spender to withdraw from their account.


    ## Standardization and Interoperability: By adhering to the ERC-20 standard, tokens
       ensure compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem, including wallets,
       decentralized exchanges, and other smart contracts that expect this standard.
