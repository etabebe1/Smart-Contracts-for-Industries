|*||| PROJECT 1.1 - Automotive industry smart contract |||*|

    Vehicle struct:
        This struct defines the properties of a vehicle, including make, model, price, vehicleId, isSold, seller, and buyer.

    listVehicle function:
        This function allows a user to list a new vehicle for sale.
        It takes in the parameters _make, _model, _price, and _vehicleId, which represent the make, model, price, and unique ID of the vehicle.
        Inside the function, a new Vehicle struct called newVehicle is created with the provided details.
        The seller address is set to msg.sender, which is the address of the user who called the function.
        The buyer address is initially set to address(0), indicating that the vehicle has not been sold yet.
        The newVehicle is then added to the vehicles array using the push function.
        Finally, the VehicleListed event is emitted, capturing the details of the newly listed vehicle.

This code allows users to list vehicles for sale by creating new Vehicle structs and adding them to the vehicles array.
Each listed vehicle will have a unique ID, and the event VehicleListed will be emitted
to notify listeners of the listing.

|*||| PROJECT 1.2 - Automotive industry smart contract |||*|

This smart contract represents an automotive contract that allows users to buy vehicles. 

    State Variables:
        owner: This variable stores the address of the contract owner.
        buyers: This is a mapping that keeps track of buyers and whether they have already made a purchase.
        vehicleMake and vehicleModel: These variables store the make and model of the vehicle.
        vehiclePrice: This variable stores the price of the vehicle.

    Event:
        Purchase: This event is emitted when a vehicle is purchased. It logs the buyer's address, vehicle make and model, and the vehicle price.

    Constructor:
        The constructor is executed when the contract is deployed. It sets the owner variable to the address of the contract deployer.

    buyVehicle Function:
        This function allows users to buy a vehicle by providing the vehicle make and model as arguments.
        The function requires that the value sent with the transaction (msg.value) is greater than or equal to the vehiclePrice.
        It also checks that the buyer has not already made a purchase (buyers[msg.sender] == false).
        If the conditions are met, the vehicle make and model are updated, and the buyer is marked as having made a purchase.
        The Purchase event is emitted, capturing the buyer's address, vehicle make and model, and the vehicle price.


||#|| Banking industry smart contract ||#||

|*||| PROJECT 2.1 - Banking industry smart contract |||*|

In the Solidity code, we have a smart contract called Banking. Let's go through the different parts of the contract:

    deposit Function:
        # This function allows users to deposit an amount of Ether into their balance.
        # It requires that the deposited amount is greater than 0.
        # The function increases the balance of the msg.sender address by the deposited amount.

    withdraw Function:
        # This function allows the owner of the contract to withdraw 
          an amount of Ether from their balance.
        # It requires that the caller of the function is the owner of the contract (msg.sender == owner).
        # It also requires that the withdrawal amount is not greater than
          the balance of the owner and is greater than 0.
        # The function transfers the specified amount of Ether to the owner's
          address and decreases their balance accordingly.

    transfer Function:
        # This function allows the caller to transfer a specified amount of Ether to a recipient address.
        # It requires that the transfer amount is not greater than the caller's balance.

|*||| PROJECT 3.2 - Crowd funding smart contract |||*|

In the provided smart contract, CrowdFund, is a crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum
blockchain using the Solidity programming language. It leverages ERC20 tokens as the 
medium of exchange, allowing users to fund projects (campaigns) of their choice with 
specific tokens. Here’s an overview of its main features and functionalities:
 => Key Components

    # ERC20 Token Interface (IERC20): This contract interface defines the standard 
      functions of ERC20 tokens that are used within the CrowdFund contract, namely 
      transfer and transferFrom. These functions enable the contract to send and 
      receive the ERC20 tokens that are used for crowdfunding.

    # Campaign Structure: A struct that stores essential data about each crowdfunding 
      campaign, including the creator's address, the funding goal, total pledged amount,
      start and end timestamps, and a flag indicating whether the funds have been claimed.

    # Events: The contract defines several events (Launch, Cancel, Pledge, Unpledge, Claim,
      Refund) to log significant actions on the blockchain, providing transparency for all
      interactions with the contract.

=> Main Functionalities

    # Launching a Campaign: Users can create a new crowdfunding campaign by specifying the
      funding goal, start time, and end time. The contract ensures that the start time 
      is in the future and the duration does not exceed a predefined maximum (90 days).

    # Cancelling a Campaign: The creator of a campaign can cancel it before it
      starts, ensuring that users have control over their campaigns if conditions change 
      before the fundraising begins.

    # Pledging to a Campaign: Users can support a campaign by pledging ERC20 tokens
      to it. The contract updates the total pledged amount and records the contribution 
      against the user's address.

    # Unpledging: Users can withdraw their pledge from a campaign before it ends,
      offering flexibility and control over their funds.

    # Claiming Funds: Upon the successful completion of a campaign (i.e., reaching
      or surpassing the funding goal by the end time), the campaign creator can claim the 
      pledged funds.

    # Refunds: If a campaign does not reach its funding goal, contributors can
      claim a refund of their pledged tokens after the campaign ends.

=> Security and Flexibility

The contract includes checks to ensure actions are performed within the correct context
(e.g., campaigns can only be cancelled before they start, funds can only be claimed after
 the end, etc.). It uses the require statements extensively to enforce rules and validate conditions.

The code snippet you've provided involves importing an interface for ERC-20 tokens 
using OpenZeppelin, a widely recognized library in the Ethereum development community 
for secure smart contract development. This particular import statement is typically
used at the beginning of a Solidity smart contract file when the contract needs to 
interact with ERC-20 tokens, whether it's creating a new token that complies with 
the ERC-20 standard or interacting with existing ERC-20 tokens on the blockchain.

=> Key Points of the Code:

    Use of OpenZeppelin Contracts: OpenZeppelin provides a set of secure, audited, and 
    community-reviewed smart contracts that implement various blockchain standards and utilities. 
    By importing from OpenZeppelin, developers leverage this expertise and security in 
    their own contracts.

    ## IERC20 Interface: The IERC20 interface defines a set of functions that an ERC-20 token contract should implement, allowing for standardized interactions such as transferring tokens, approving tokens for spending by third parties, and querying balance information. The functions include:
        # totalSupply: Returns the total token supply.
        
        # balanceOf: Provides the number of tokens held by a given address.
        
        # transfer: Enables the transfer of tokens from the message sender's
          account to another account.
        
        # approve: Allows a spender to withdraw a specified amount of tokens
          from a specified account.
        
        # transferFrom: Facilitates the transfer of tokens from one account to another, 
          based on a previously set allowance.
        
        # allowance: Returns the amount of tokens that an owner has allowed
         a spender to withdraw from their account.


    ## Standardization and Interoperability: By adhering to the ERC-20 standard, tokens
       ensure compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem, including wallets,
       decentralized exchanges, and other smart contracts that expect this standard.
