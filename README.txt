    Vehicle struct:
        This struct defines the properties of a vehicle, including make, model, price, vehicleId, isSold, seller, and buyer.

    listVehicle function:
        This function allows a user to list a new vehicle for sale.
        It takes in the parameters _make, _model, _price, and _vehicleId, which represent the make, model, price, and unique ID of the vehicle.
        Inside the function, a new Vehicle struct called newVehicle is created with the provided details.
        The seller address is set to msg.sender, which is the address of the user who called the function.
        The buyer address is initially set to address(0), indicating that the vehicle has not been sold yet.
        The newVehicle is then added to the vehicles array using the push function.
        Finally, the VehicleListed event is emitted, capturing the details of the newly listed vehicle.

This code allows users to list vehicles for sale by creating new Vehicle structs and adding them to the vehicles array.
Each listed vehicle will have a unique ID, and the event VehicleListed will be emitted
to notify listeners of the listing.

This smart contract represents an automotive contract that allows users to buy vehicles. 

    State Variables:
        owner: This variable stores the address of the contract owner.
        buyers: This is a mapping that keeps track of buyers and whether they have already made a purchase.
        vehicleMake and vehicleModel: These variables store the make and model of the vehicle.
        vehiclePrice: This variable stores the price of the vehicle.

    Event:
        Purchase: This event is emitted when a vehicle is purchased. It logs the buyer's address, vehicle make and model, and the vehicle price.

    Constructor:
        The constructor is executed when the contract is deployed. It sets the owner variable to the address of the contract deployer.

    buyVehicle Function:
        This function allows users to buy a vehicle by providing the vehicle make and model as arguments.
        The function requires that the value sent with the transaction (msg.value) is greater than or equal to the vehiclePrice.
        It also checks that the buyer has not already made a purchase (buyers[msg.sender] == false).
        If the conditions are met, the vehicle make and model are updated, and the buyer is marked as having made a purchase.
        The Purchase event is emitted, capturing the buyer's address, vehicle make and model, and the vehicle price.


||#|| Banking industry smart contract ||#||

|*||| PROJECT 2.1 - Banking industry smart contract |||*|

In the Solidity code, we have a smart contract called Banking. Let's go through the different parts of the contract:

    State Variables:
        balances: This is a mapping that associates an address with a balance. 
                  It keeps track of the balances of different addresses.
        owner: This is an address variable that represents the owner of the contract.

    Constructor:
        The constructor function is executed when the contract is deployed. 
        It sets the owner variable to the address of the contract deployer (msg.sender).

    deposit Function:
        # This function allows users to deposit an amount of Ether into their balance.
        # It requires that the deposited amount is greater than 0.
        # The function increases the balance of the msg.sender address by the deposited amount.

    withdraw Function:
        # This function allows the owner of the contract to withdraw 
          an amount of Ether from their balance.
        # It requires that the caller of the function is the owner of the contract (msg.sender == owner).
        # It also requires that the withdrawal amount is not greater than
          the balance of the owner and is greater than 0.
        # The function transfers the specified amount of Ether to the owner's
          address and decreases their balance accordingly.

    transfer Function:
        # This function allows the caller to transfer a specified amount of Ether to a recipient address.
        # It requires that the transfer amount is not greater than the caller's balance.
        # The function transfers the specified amount of Ether to the recipient address and 
          updates the balances of the caller and recipient accordingly.

Overall, this contract provides basic banking functionalities such as depositing, withdrawing,
and transferring Ether. The balances mapping keeps track of the balances of different addresses.
